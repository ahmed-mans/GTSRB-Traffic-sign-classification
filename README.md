# Traffic Sign Image classification - 94% Accuracy

## üö¶ Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to train a __Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)__ from scratch to classify traffic sign images into __43 distinct categories__.
Each class represents a specific traffic sign, such as:
```
0: 20 km/h,  
1: 30 km/h,  
2: 50 km/h,  
...  
42: End of the overtaking restriction
```

### üß™ Implementation

The full training and implementation process is contained in the notebook `traffic_sign_classification.ipynb`.

It includes:
- Dataset preprocessing
- Custom CNN architecture<br>
- Training and evaluation of the model

## üóÇÔ∏è Dataset Description
The dataset contains a total of __51,83 images__ categorized into __43 traffic sign classes__.

It is divided into:
- __Training set__: 39,209 images
- __Test set__: 12,630 images

The image below showcases a few sample classes from the training set, along with the __number of images per class__ indicated in brackets.

To train the CNN model effectively, the original training set was divided into two subsets:

- __80%__ for training<br>
- __20%__ for validation.

### Notes

- **Class imbalance** is present in the dataset. For example:  
  - **Class 0** (`20 km/h`) has only **210 images**  
  - **Class 1** (`30 km/h`) has over **2,000 images**

  This imbalance can affect model performance and may require techniques like **class weighting** or **data augmentation** to mitigate it.

## üß† CNN Model Architecture

This project features a **custom-built Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** tailored for traffic sign classification.

- The architecture includes **two convolutional blocks**, each consisting of:
  - Two consecutive `Conv2D` layers with activation functions  
  - Followed by `MaxPooling` layers for downsampling

- The extracted features are then passed through **four fully connected (Dense) layers**, ending with a **final output layer** using `softmax` activation to produce class probabilities across the **43 traffic sign classes**.
